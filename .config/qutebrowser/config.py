# Definitions of search engines which can be used via the address bar.
# Maps a searchengine name (such as `DEFAULT`, or `ddg`) to a URL with a
# `{}` placeholder. The placeholder will be replaced by the search term,
# use `{{` and `}}` for literal `{`/`}` signs. The searchengine named
# `DEFAULT` is used when `url.auto_search` is turned on and something
# else than a URL was entered to be opened. Other search engines can be
# used by prepending the search engine name to the search term, e.g.
# `:open google qutebrowser`.
# Type: Dict
c.url.searchengines = {'DEFAULT': 'https://duckduckgo.com/?q={}', 'g': 'https://google.com/search?q={}'}
